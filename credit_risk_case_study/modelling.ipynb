    "- **Dummification** is used to transform categorical variables into numerical variables, since most machine learning models can only deal with numerical variables. You probably already encountered this in your statistics course since linear regression requires dummification.\n",
    "- In dummification, we transform a categorical variable with N values into C_0, ..., C_N columns that take only 0 or 1 values. A row then has exactly one of these columns with 1, and the others with 0, namely, the column corresponding to the original value of the categorical variable for that row.\n",
    "- Note that there are alternative ways to deal with categorical variables. One is to use ordinal encoding, which simply encodes the categorical variable as integers. In the above dataset, the categorical variables of education, gender, marriage, etc. are ordinally encoded\n",
    "- Ordinal encoding, however, introduces an order between the categories which doesn't necessarily make sense and can cause problems for ML algorithms. For instance, if we have two categories \"male\" and \"female\", and we encode them as 0 and 1, then we are also encoding that \"male\" < \"female\" since 0 < 1. Which does not make sense and can lead to issues with the models, for instance predictions in-between classes\n",
    "- In our dataset, one might argue that while there is a natural order for education, no such order exists for sex and marriage. Therefore, we are going to one-hot encode the sex and marriage variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the sklearn one hot encoder to encode the sex and marriage variables. The education variable we will leave as an ordinal (integer) variable. See\n",

    "- this is performed because often numerical variables can have wildly different ranges; for instance, the \"age\" variable in the above dataset has a very different range from the \"limit_bal\" variable.\n",
    "- this can cause problems to machine learning models, in particular those, like SVM, that rely on measuring distances in e.g. Euclidean spaces. Without scaling, features whose range is in the high numers (e.g. limit_bal) will come to dominate the distance measures used in the algorithms, and features with ranges in the low numbers (e.g. age) will have little to no impact on the model\n",
    "- there are many ways to standardize variables (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling). The most common are:\n",

In our case, the hyperparameters must be set before we can train and then predict with the model.\n",
