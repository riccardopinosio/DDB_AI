# AI for business - practicals 2024-2025

Dear students,

This repository contains the practicals for the AI for business course. Each practical is contained in a separate folder and consists in one or more jupyer notebooks. The notebooks are numbered in the order in which they should be completed.

To be able to run these notebooks, you will first need to clone the repository on your local machine.

You will then need to create a conda environment with the requried dependencies. The dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file in this folder. To install the dependencies in an existing conda environment, you can run the following command from a terminal after activating the environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

When this is done, you should be able to run the jupyter notebooks in the newly created environment. Note that the datasets used in the notebooks are contained in the datasets folder.
